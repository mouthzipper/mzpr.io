New Year, New Blog!

<p>`Hello World!`, a cute phrase that welcomes me into the world of programming few years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Watch out here to read some boring stuffs. I will be sharing my experiences, do some tutorials in coding, leadership, trading or any other stuff I can think of.</p>

<p>Beware! I suck at English, expected to read a lot of wrong grammar and probably spelling(I might to tired to google the correct spelling :)</p>
